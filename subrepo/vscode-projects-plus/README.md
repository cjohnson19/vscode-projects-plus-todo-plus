An extension for managing projects. Feature rich, customizable, automatically finds your projects.

It comes packed with a lot of features:
- **Groups**: if you have many projects you'll find the ability to separate them into groups pretty valuable. Groups can be nested indefinitely.
- **Group switching**: if you have many groups, you can choose to view only projects belonging to a single one of them. Switching between groups is super easy.
- **GitTower integration** (macOS): if you are already using the awesome [GitTower](https://www.git-tower.com) for managing your repositories this extension can automatically import your repositories!
- **VSCode/Git/SVN/HG integration**: it can find your VSCode, Git, SubVersion and Mercurial projects too.
- **Customizable**: add icons, sort groups/repositories manually or by name, custom indentation width, hide paths/descriptions, switch paths/descriptions position, customizable statusbar component.
- **Explorer/Activity Bar view**: it adds a view for easy switching between projects.
- **Extra informations**: it can show you extra informations about your projects:
  - **Ahead/Behind** (Git): enable the `projects.showAheadBehind` setting to see how many commits ahead or behind the repository is.
  - **Branch** (Git): enable the `projects.showBranch` setting to have the branch of a repository displayed next to its name. You can filter out branches via the `projects.ignoreBranches` setting.
  - **Dirty state** (Git): enable the `projects.checkDirty` setting to have an icon indicating that a repository is dirty (has uncommitted changes) next to its name. If you have many projects the very first time you open your projects list it may tike a bit.
  - **Path existence**: enable the `projects.checkPaths` setting to have an icon indicating which projects are currently non-openable next to their name. For instance if you have projects inside encrypted disk images this extension will basically tell you which are unmounted.

## Configuration

Run the `Projects: Edit Configuration` command to create the configuration file. By default it uses a file named `vscode_projects.json` under your home directory, you can change this by supplying a custom path using the `projects.configPath` setting entry.

The configuration is an object that looks like this:

```js
{
  "groups": [{ // Array of groups
    "name": "Group", // Group's name
    "description": "Just a group", // Group's description
    "icon": "globe", // Group's icon
    "projects": [], // Array of projects
    "groups": [], // Groups can be nested indefinitely
  }],
  "projects": [{ // Array of projects
    "name": "Project", // Project's name
    "icon": "code", // Project's icon
    "description": "My awesome project", // Project's description
    "path": "/path/to/project" // Project's path
  }]
}
```

- **[Projects+ Todo+](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-projects-plus-todo-plus)**: Bird's-eye view over your projects, view all your todo files aggregated into one.
- **[Open in GitTower](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-open-in-gittower)**: use this extension for opening your projects in GitTower.

## Hints

- **Activity Bar**: you can switch the focus to the `Projects` activity bar view by assigning a shortcut to the `workbench.view.extension.projects` command.
- **GitTower**: organize your repositories there and then run `Terminals: Refresh` to have this extension copy your configuration.
- **Sync projects**: make `projects.configPath` point to a file in your Dropbox directory to have it synced between computers. Write paths as `~/path/to/project` in order to make them cross-platform.
- **[Commands](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-commands)**: Use this other extension and the `projects.openByName` command to add buttons to the statusbar for easy switching between projects or groups.
- **Icons**: [here](https://octicons.github.com/) you can browse a list of supported icons. If for instance you click the first icon, you'll get a page with `.octicon-alert` written in it, to get the string to use simply remove the `.octicon-` part, so in this case the icon name would be `alert`.
